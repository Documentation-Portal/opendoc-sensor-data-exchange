3. On first sign up within organization, your role will be a **PUBLISHER**. 

   On second sign up with the same organization, your role will be a **SUBSCRIBER**.

   You can now share information, browse to latest topics, and create your own projects and topics, see [Insert x-ref - Browse Topics].

You can send a request through email to <sense@tech.gov.sg> to change the role as Administrator to access Administrative features such as manage users.

4. As a Publisher to publish your relevant information, you must first create your Project to create a topic. You can   also subscribe to your own topic. 

   A topic cannot be duplicated and cannot published and subscribed to the same project again. 
   
   Both Publisher and Subscriber can create a project, but only the Publisher can create topic. 
   
   Here is an example use case scenario:
   
   The National Environment Agency (NEA) would like to publish and share environment-related information about Rainfall.
   
   In SDX portal, NEA creates a Project about Rainfall and creates a Topic about total rainfall for the month and publish it. A subscription approval is needed for agencies to subscribes to the topic.
